        <p><span class='tab'></span>This page is an example of a Flask webpage, built in Python and with HTML code. The site itself is hosted on Amazon Web Services, and through my own personal domain.</p>
        <p><span class='tab'></span>My next planned project to display here is an application of machine learning. It will be a classifier machine learning model.</p>
        <p><span class='tab'></span>In addition, I anticipate two opportunities over the span of the next year. One will be a second data visualization model, titled "Analyzing the Connection between Surface Freshwater Lenses and Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico using Satellite Observations and Model simulations." This would be a research project sponsored by a professor at my university, and will tentatively take place during the Spring and Summer semesters. The next project is one sponsored by my university under the Magellan Research Scholarship, and under the tutelage of one of my math professors. This project is aimed at producing a recurrent machine learning model capable of creating a logically sound sequence of deductions for first-order logic; or, put more simply, it will be able to solve logical proofs with correct methods and conclusions. Because of the complexity of the second one, it will tentatively span the entirety of the next year.</p>
